## Demo
[Find a Coach Demo](https://find-a-coach-app-udemy.netlify.app/coaches)

<br>

## Introduction
This application will have two main features:

  1. find a coach;

  2. send requests (messages) to potential coaches which we want to contact.

<br>

In `find a coach` you will be able to:
  * list all available coaches;
  * filter a coach based on his/hers area of expertise;
  * view coach details;
  * register as a coach;
  * contact a, specific, coach by leaving your email and share a message to your selected coach.

Contact a coach feature will, also, establish the connection to the other part off this web app, the requests part.

In `requests` we will be able to:
  * send requests to coaches;
  * as a registered coach, view all your incoming requests (messages) and use the email address to reply back;

Last, but not least, the `authentication`:
  * add users, so they can login and sign up;
  * allow the ones that sign up to become a coach.

It uses routing and animations (more new features learned).

It also uses `Vuex` to manage data.

The backend server is hosted by [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

<br>

## Project setup
Clone or fork the project.

Then, install all the required packages and dependencies:

`cd` into your new folder and, in there, run:
```
npm install
```

Once all the dependencies have been installed start the development server with:

```
npm run serve
```

<br>

## Conclusion
With this project I was able to practice what I have learned thus far and also apply new Vue features such as routing and Vuex, as well as authentication (including navigation guards).

This project allowed me to push forward and create a more dynamic and elaborated Vue.js application.

Great focus on `vue-router`, `Vuex`, `authentication` and `HTTP requests`.
