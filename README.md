## Demo
[Find a Coach Demo](https://find-a-coach-app-udemy.netlify.app/coaches)

<br>

## Introduction
This application will have two main features:

  1. find a coach

  2. send requests (messages) to potential coaches which we want to contact.

<br>

In `find a coach` you will be able to:
  * list all available coaches;
  * filter a coach based on his/hers area of expertise;
  * view coach details;
  * register as a coach;
  * contact a, specific, coach by leaving your email and share a message to your selected coach.

Contact a coach feature will, also, establish the connection to the other part off this web app, the requests part.

In `requests` we will be able to:
  * send requests to coaches;
  * as a registered coach, view all your the incoming requests (messages) and use the email address to reply back;

<br>

It uses routing and animations (new features learned).

It also uses `Vuex` to manage data.

The backend server is hosted by [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

<br>

## Project setup
Clone or fork the project.

Then, install all the required packages and dependencies:

`cd` into your new folder and in there run:
```
npm install
```

Once all the dependencies have been installed start the development server with:

```
npm run serve
```

## Conclusion
With this project I was able to practice what I have learned thus far and also apply new Vue features such as routing and Vuex.

This project allowed me to push forward and create a more dynamic and elaborated Vue.js application.

Great focus on `vue-router`, `Vuex`, and `HTTP requests`.
